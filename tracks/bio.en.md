# ORGANIZERS

## Cuban Tech Group

The Cuban Tech Group is devoted to providing a foundation of major outreach for open, collaborative technology development and education, in order to help more people access computing and technology making. It is a non-profit organization to which companies and individuals can donate resources; we guarantee they will be used for the development of the Cuban technology ecosystem. Together with the PSF we will run the first PyCon Cuba 2017.

## Python Software Foundation

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. It qualifies under the US Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and educational public charity, and conducts its business according to the rules for such organizations.

******************************************************************
### Instructions for Authors

ScipyLA 2017 will publish two manuscripts. The first will be "The Python Papers (TPP)" for full peer-reviewed papers, and the other "The Python Papers Monograph (TPPM)" for abstracts.

The submission, review and final publication of both series will be managed through the [General Information on The Python Papers](http://www.pythonpapers.org/instAuthor.html)

### Submitting papers to TPP

1. [Registration](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tpp/user/register).

   You will select the registration "as author".

2. [Submit your paper by February 28](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tpp/author/submit).

    2.1. Select the option "Peer-reviewed Articles", and follow the instructions.

    2.2. **Important:** add **ScipyLA2017** in the field "Comments for the Editor".

3. Reviewers on the subject will make their assessment.

4. You will be notified of the editorial decision by March 30 (see __Important Dates__ section).

    4.1 REJECTED: You will be able to read the reviewer's comments.

    4.2 ACCEPTED: You will be asked to address the reviewers comments and submit the camera-ready version by April 15 (see __Important Dates__ section).

### Submitting abstracts to TPPM 

"For poster-only submissions, follow the previous steps, selecting "[Register as author in TPPM](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tppm/user/register)" instead of "as author". You will only be required to submit the abstract of your presentation.

### Papers Template

# ACADEMIC PROPERTIES

The conference offers the Latin American researchers the opportunity to publish in an international Journal. Furthermore, you could contribute to the convention's main objectives: reproducible science, effective divulgation of scientific discoveries, communication of Python experiences and contributions to science, to the scientific and technological development of Cuba and Latin America.

## Languages

Spanish, Portuguese, English

## Important Dates

* New reviewers acceptance: February 28, 2016
* Submission deadline: February 21, 2017
* Reviewers response: March 30, 2017
* Camera-ready submission: April 15, 2017

## Activities

* **Tutorials** : Workshops on Python tools offered by experts and aimed at improving the productivity of researchers.

* **Presentations and lectures** Keynote speakers will talk about global trends and best practices in science.

* **Poster Sessions** You could present investigation pipeline and results using visually appealing tools.

* **Sprints** Meet the authors of recognized libraries in order to implement more efficient ways to perform scientific calculations.

* **Lightning Talks** Promote and expand the scope of researches by briefly presenting ideas to specialists of the region.

## Subscription / Participation / Payment

Subcription to the event will be free. Your participation will depend on the papers you send and their quality. If you are selected, you will have to guarantee your  stay in Havana through tourist packages not offered directly by the conference.
