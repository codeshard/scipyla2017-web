# ORGANIZERS

## Cuban Tech Group

The Cuban Tech Group is devoted to providing a foundation of major outreach for open, collaborative technology development and education, in order to help more people access computing and technology making. It is a non-profit organization to which companies and individuals can donate resources; we guarantee they will be used for the development of the Cuban technology ecosystem. Together with the PSF we will run the first PyCon Cuba 2017.

## Python Software Foundation

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. It qualifies under the US Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and educational public charity, and conducts its business according to the rules for such organizations.

### Instructions for Authors

ScipyLA 2017 will publish two manuscripts. The first will be "The Python Papers (TPP)" for full peer-reviewed papers, and the other "The Python Papers Monograph (TPPM)" for abstracts.

The submission, review and final publication of both series will be managed through the [General Information on The Python Papers](http://www.pythonpapers.org/instAuthor.html)

### Submitting papers to TPP

1. [Registration](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tpp/user/register).

   You will select the registration "as author".

2. [Submit your paper by February 28](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tpp/author/submit).

    2.1. Select the option "Peer-reviewed Articles", and follow the instructions.

    2.2. **Important:** add **ScipyLA2017** in the field "Comments for the Editor".

3. Reviewers on the subject will make their assessment.

4. You will be notified of the editorial decision by March 30 (see __Important Dates__ section).

    4.1 REJECTED: You will be able to read the reviewer's comments.

    4.2 ACCEPTED: You will be asked to address the reviewers comments and submit the camera-ready version by April 15 (see __Important Dates__ section).

### Submitting abstracts to TPPM 

"For poster-only submissions, follow the previous steps, selecting "[Register as author in TPPM](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tppm/user/register)" instead of "as author". You will only be required to submit the abstract of your presentation.
